        <div class="FooterTemp"> <h4 class="AccessibilityHeaders">Introduction</h4>
            <p>My design was influenced by the official website of the University of Sheffield. My aim is for it to be a cheerful and welcoming website for users.</p>
            <h4 class="AccessibilityHeaders">Site Map</h4>
            <img src="./images/Site Map.png" id="SiteMapImg" alt="Site Map">
            <p>The boxes withe the purple background represent the pages on the navigation bar. The others represent the pages on the footer.</p>
            <p>I decided to go with this structure as the website is simple and there would be no need to nest any webpages into each other.</p>
            <h4 class="AccessibilityHeaders">Design Mockups</h4>
            <img src="./images/Mobile Design.png" id="MobileDesign" alt="Mobile Design Mockup Image">

            <div id="Reasoning"><h4 class="AccessibilityHeaders">Design Reasoning</h4>
            <p><span>For Mobile Phones:</span> I did not make any margins for the main section on the mobile. I went with this design because it looks neat and fills the small screen with content, so it would look nice, be readable, and moore accessible. The navigation bar is taking the whole width so it would be able to hold its content wothout cramming them together. Images are taking full width as well for better quality. They are laid out in a row form to be able tp fit the content without making anything so small to the point of being unaccessible. It is responsive for all devices except for the Galaxy Fold as it is an unusually small phone in terms of width, which made it hard to fit the content. I would have had to sarcrifice the quality and readabilty of the page to make the content fit into a Galaxy Fold.</p>
            <p><span>For Narrow Devices:</span> There is not much difference at all. I just moved content around to fill the page and not leave much space between the content and the footer</p>
            <p><span>For Desktop Screen:</span> I changed the design of the navigation bar. I integrated it into the header itself so they are all on the same line. I changed it because on desktop screens, if i left the old navigation bar design, the navigation bar content would be too spreadout and would not look nice. Moreover, in the homoepage, i put the images side to side so there would not be much of space between the image and the edge.</p>
            <p>The design for the Members, Agenda, Contact, Accessibility, Legal & Security, Design, and Testing are similar to each other.</p> 
            <h4 class="AccessibilityHeaders">Menu System</h4>
            <div class="LastThing"><p class="LastThing">For mobile phones and narrow devices, I made a whole bar for the navigation system to fit its content. However, when it reaches 1200px of width (desktop screens), the navigation bar becomes a part of the main header.</p>
